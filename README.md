# Finite Automata Designer

The **Finite Automata Designer** is a graphical tool for creating and managing finite automata. It allows you to add and remove states, add transitions, select multiple final states, save and load finite automata from files, and test input strings.

## Features

- **Add/Remove States**: Dynamically manage states in the finite automaton.
- **Add Transitions**: Define transitions between states with labels.
- **Configure Final States**: Mark states as final or remove them from the final state list.
- **Save/Load Automata**: Save and load finite automata definitions from `.dot` files.
- **Test Input Strings**: Check if a given input string is accepted by the finite automaton.

## Dependencies

- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image handling.
- **Pygraphviz**: For graph representation and manipulation.
